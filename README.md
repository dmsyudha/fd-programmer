## Main Branch Merged-Number 1
While this merge demonstrates competence in handling external API integration and secure coding practices, there's room for improvement in error handling refinement and documentation. The focus on integration and security suggests an intermediate level of experience, with a good grasp of external service interactions but still room for growth in areas like error management and optimization.
